This is a SiriProxy plugin called "SimonSays". 

It works just like the normal Simon says game, but Siri works as "Simon".

The Plugin is not finished atm, but it works. 

Just put in your config.yml:

    - name: 'SimonSays'
      git: 'git://github.com/ihardyslide/siriproxy-simonsays.git'

Thats all! To activate say: "Simon says"
